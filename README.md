# PowerSpriteFrames
Simple Python script for Blender that rotates and renders a character rig for marked animations frames.

I created this to support a 3D to 2D reference workflow for creating animations for some adventure game projects I working using PowerQuest for Unity.
I eventually would like to do more 3D in Unity itself. However, this is very useful to create 2D animations or reference. The supporting Blender project also decreases resolution without anti-alias and has some compositing options to reduce colors, etc.

Example Blender file included that outputs to specified path in Output Properties (see Scripting tab to execute)
